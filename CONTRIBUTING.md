# Contributing

## Overview

This documents explains the processes and practices recommended for contributing enhancements to
this operator.

- Generally, before developing enhancements to this charm, you should consider
  [opening an issue](https://github.com/canonical/mysql-router-operators/issues) explaining your use case.
- If you would like to chat with us about your use-cases or proposed implementation, you can reach
  us at the [Data Platform matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#charmhub-data-platform:ubuntu.com).
- Familiarising yourself with the [Juju framework](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/)
  library will help you a lot when working on new features or bug fixes.
- All enhancements require review before being merged. Code review typically examines:
  - Code quality
  - Test coverage
  - User experience for Juju administrators of this charm.
- Please help us out in ensuring easy to review branches by rebasing your pull request branch onto
  the `dpe` branch. This also avoids merge commits and creates a linear Git commit history.
